=========== RAG ================
step-1: you need to load the data
step-2: split the data into chunks
step-3: apply the any embeddings model to convert that chunks to a vector
step-4: vector database
step-5: a new question query user asking
step-6: this new query also into embeddings
step-7: this vector multiply with each and every vector chunk
step-8: which is the most similar that is our output
